# Port Security Scanner - Enhancement Summary

## Overview
The Port Security Scanner has been significantly enhanced with advanced port closing capabilities and official patch download functionality. All requested features have been successfully implemented and tested.

## ‚úÖ Completed Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Port Closing Functionality
- **Multiple Closure Methods**: Implemented comprehensive port closing using multiple techniques
- **Linux Support**:
  - Service stopping with `systemctl`
  - Process killing with `netstat` and `kill` commands
  - Firewall blocking with `iptables`
  - Fallback methods with `fuser`
- **Windows Support**:
  - Service stopping with `sc` command
  - Process killing with `taskkill`
  - Windows Firewall blocking with `netsh`
  - PowerShell firewall rules as additional method
- **Process Detection**: Advanced process identification for both Linux and Windows
- **Success Tracking**: Reports which methods successfully closed the port

### 2. Official Patch Download System
- **Trusted Sources**: Downloads patches from official repositories only
- **Linux Sources**:
  - Ubuntu security repositories
  - Debian security updates
  - CentOS/RHEL official mirrors
- **Windows Sources**:
  - Microsoft Update Catalog
  - Windows Update API integration
  - Official Microsoft download servers
- **Distribution Detection**: Automatic detection of Linux distribution for appropriate sources
- **Update Verification**: Checks for available updates before attempting installation

### 3. Patch Integrity Verification
- **SHA256 Hashing**: Cryptographic verification of downloaded patches
- **File Integrity**: Ensures patches are not corrupted during download
- **Security Validation**: Prevents installation of tampered or malicious patches
- **Cache Management**: Organized patch storage with integrity tracking

### 4. Automated Mode Operation
- **Non-Interactive Mode**: `--auto` or `-a` flag for automated operation
- **Safety Checks**: Built-in safety mechanisms for automated mode
- **Comprehensive Actions**: Applies both updates AND port closure automatically
- **Logging**: Full audit trail even in automated mode

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Multiple Retry Attempts**: Robust retry logic for failed operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even if some methods fail
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Comprehensive error messages and logging
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Ability to restore previous states if needed

### 6. Advanced Process Management
- **Cross-Platform Detection**: Works on both Linux and Windows
- **PID Identification**: Accurate process identification using port numbers
- **Service Mapping**: Intelligent mapping of ports to system services
- **Clean Termination**: Proper process termination with cleanup
